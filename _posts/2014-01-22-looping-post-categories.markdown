Wordpress loves its data loops. They allow you to access much of your databse content on a very specific level. One of the most important nodes of content distribution comes in the form of "categories". Wordpress allows you to categorize posts so you can sort and distribute them over multiple dynamic locations in your site. For instance, your homepage may show only the three most recent posts categorized as **update** but another page shows only the most recent posts cateogorized as **testimonial**. 

In your PHP (presumably within a template file of your wordpress theme) you can create a wordpress loop instance and build in specific parameters through an array. A wordpress loop query is constructed with the following *core* function:

{% highlight php %}
$query = new WP_Query();
{% endhighlight %}

Within the query function you can then insert your array of parameters, which typically take on the following syntax:

{% highlight php %}
array(
	'item' => 'item_type',
	'item2' => 9,
	'item3' => 'another-thing'
);
{% endhighlight %}

To put it all to use it's best practice to wrap your execution within a statement that tests to make sure your query for specific posts returns more than **zero** results, otherwise there's no point in running through more PHP. Below is how you would put it all together including an **error statement**.

{% highlight php linenos %}
<?php
// build your query
$query = new WP_Query( array('category_name' => 'category_slug', 'posts_per_page' => 5 ));

// execute the loop ONLY if there are posts associated to your query
if ( $query->have_posts() ) : ?>

      <!-- the loop -->

      <?php while ( $query->have_posts() ) : $query->the_post(); ?>
            <h1><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
            <?php the_date(); ?>
            <?php the_content(); ?>
      <?php endwhile; ?>

      <!-- end of the loop -->

      <?php wp_reset_postdata(); ?>

<?php else:  ?>
  <p><?php _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.' ); ?></p>
<?php endif; ?>
{% endhighlight %}

Of course there are many degrees of customization within the loop you can develop for. Every post has an abundance of meta data that is accessible within the above loop, allowing you to very specifically place content within custom HTML.

Happy looping!
